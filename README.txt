Thank you for using the PoemBuilder!

This program is meant to be a collaboration between the creator and the user. As such, feel free to edit punctuation, line breaks, and word choice (especially words like "us," "I," "yours," "ours," etc) to make the poems your own. 

If you post or publish a poem created using the PoemBuilder, please also credit the PoemBuilder and its creator, Daniel Dykiel.

When you finish creating your poem, the program will create a file in the PoemBuilder folder, and save your poem there. If you create multiple poems in one session, the program will create a file for each poem.

NOTE: If you open the program, create poems, then close the program, then run it again, the program will rewrite your previous files. To preserve your files, you can move them out of the PoemBuilder folder or re-name the files.
